# Neopixel-Beatsync-Project
The ultimate goal of the project is to control some attributes, primarily timing of the twinklesparkle2014.ino from ID3 info pushed from an mp3 file as the file is played.

Here Daniel Wilson suggests using on serial connection to control timing.

also has great information on how to create a very simply LED controller with processing. So far it is my understanding that this has to be done one .mp3 file at a time. 

If info such as BPM and delay could be scraped from an ID3 tag this would be a better way to time a series of mp3 songs.
